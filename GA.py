Sebastian Ballesteros - 40114697
This is a genetic algorithm used applied on a population of 10 citiies, each with an x and y
coordinate. The goal of the algorithm is to solve the famous travelling salesman problem.
'''

'''
Algorithm Definitions:
population - array of individuals tuples, each with (x,y) coordinate
order - array of randomly generate numbers which indicates  order to visit the cities
fitness - array of fitness values for each member of the population
best_distance - best numerical distance found so far
optimal_order - order for visiting cities which yields the best distance

1. INITIAL POPULATION.
    Read CSV file with the dataset information needed to create the cities
    The population will consist of multiple arrays filled with random sequence
    of numbers i.e [1,2,4,10, etc..] which is the order on which the cities are
    going to be visited in
    For every element in the population, its fitness score its stored in the
    fitness array in the same index

2. REPRODUCTION
    We must fit the chromosomes to reproduce offspring according to
    their fitness values. So we are going to have a new population.
    In addition, we will calculate the parents through a function, which
    is going to pick a chromosome based on its fitness value. After producing
    offspring we are going to apply crossover and mutation for each child.

'''
3. CROSSOVER
    Crossover is implemented the following way: first by generating two random numbers
    between 0 and 9 which will be the indeces taken from the father as [start, end],
    later we will perfom crossover by taking the cities remained from the mother as long
    as they don't already exist in the child's chromosome.

    #complement the new chromosomes' DNA with the mother's random DNA part

            child.append(mother[i])

'''
4.MUTATION
    The implementation of mutation is really easy, just swap two random
    generated cities to produce the new chromosome.
'''
